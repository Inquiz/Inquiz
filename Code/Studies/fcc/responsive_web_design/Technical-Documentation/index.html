          <p>Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. It originated in Italy and is known for its strong flavor and thick consistency.</p>
          <p>Espresso is the base for many popular coffee drinks such as lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.</p>
          <p>Unlike drip coffee, espresso is brewed quickly and served in small amounts, typically 1 oz or less.</p>
          <p>The brewing process involves high pressure, typically around 9 bars, and a precise grind size.</p>
          <pre><code>Grind size: fine</code></pre>
          <pre><code>Pressure: 9 bars</code></pre>

          <header>Espresso Machine Components</header>
          <p>There are several key components of an espresso machine that work together to brew espresso:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Boiler: Heats water to the perfect brewing temperature.</li>
              <li>Group Head: Distributes water evenly over the coffee grounds.</li>
              <li>Portafilter: Holds the ground coffee for brewing.</li>
              <li>Steam Wand: Used to steam and froth milk.</li>
              <li>Pressure Gauge: Measures the pressure inside the machine.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre><code>Machine pressure: 9 bars</code></pre>
          <pre><code>Water temperature: 195-205Â°F</code></pre>

          <header>Making the Perfect Espresso</header>
          <p>To make the perfect espresso, several factors must be considered:</p>
          <p>1. The coffee beans should be fresh and finely ground.</p>
          <p>2. Use about 18-20 grams of coffee for a double shot of espresso.</p>
          <p>3. Tamp the grounds evenly in the portafilter to ensure even extraction.</p>
          <p>4. Brew time should be around 25-30 seconds.</p>
          <pre><code>Brew time: 25-30 seconds</code></pre>
          <pre><code>Grounds: 18-20 grams</code></pre>

          <p>Espresso is the base for many popular coffee drinks:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Latte: Espresso with steamed milk and a small amount of foam.</li>
              <li>Cappuccino: Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam.</li>
              <li>Macchiato: Espresso "marked" with a small amount of milk foam.</li>
              <li>Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water.</li>
              <li>Flat White: Similar to a latte, but with less foam.</li>
          </ul>
